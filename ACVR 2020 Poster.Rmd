# Introduction

* Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower-respiratory tract infections in infants. 
* Developing countries have the most RSV associated infant morbidity and mortality. [@RN5]
* The current monoclonal antibody, Palivizumab, is cost-prohibitive for low-resource settings.
* New products for RSV prevention are in development. [@RN38]

## Objective
Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current and novel RSV preventive interventions in Mali to inform policy recommendations for low-resource countries

# Methods

Our model considers four scenarios:

1. No intervention
1. Monthly dose of Palivizumab (mAb)
1. Single dose of long-lasting  MEDI8897 (llAb)
1. Infant mothers receive ResVax (mVax)

* We simulated the epidemiological impact of each scenario using a monthly cohort model
* We estimated associated health and economic costs
* We evaluated cost-effectiveness using WHO standards

# Results
Our analysis indicates that the long-lasting monoclonal antibody would have the largest health impact in terms of DALYs averted, Figure \@ref(fig:FrontiersDALYs).

```{r, FrontiersDALYs, fig.cap='Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as coverage increases for each intervention.', out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/FrontiersDALYs.jpeg")
```

The mAb, llAb, and mVax would be considered **very cost-effective** at up to $15, $65, and $27 per dose respectively, Figure \@ref(fig:FrontiersThresholdCosts).

```{r, FrontiersThresholdCosts, fig.cap='Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as cost per dose increases for each intervention. The red dashed line indicates the **very cost-effective** threshold, equal to the per capita GDP of Mali.', out.width="80%"}

```

If llAb were priced at less than ~$40 per dose upon market licensure then it might provide greater value for money than mVax, Figure \@ref(fig:HeadtoHead).
