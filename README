# RSV-CEA-Mali README

Code published in this repository was used to generate results for the published work titled Cost-effectiveness of infant respiratory syncytial virus preventive interventions in Mali: a modelling study to inform policy and investment decisions.

The "CostData.R" script contains Mali-specific cost input data.
The "EffectData.R" script contains Mali-specific health impact data used to calculate DALYs.
The "health_functions.R" script contains important functions used to calculate health impact.
The "AR estimate.R" script produces an RSV attack rate matrix for infants modeled in a single year birth cohort based on calendar month and infant age.
